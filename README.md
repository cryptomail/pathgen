###Pathgen -- Create, save, and play  paths mit der maus 
######(Disclaimer, I don't speak German)

###I want you to be able to:
1. create a canvas viewport
2. rubber band path points
3. delete a path point
4. modify x/y of a path point
4. select a path point and change its final orientation
5. select two adjascent path points and change the time it takes to pass between them
6. set global defaults for path points like changing the time it takes to pass between them, and orientation
7. set img/sprite for running the simulation
8. run simulation
9. output to JSON for saving


###Todo:
1. implement rubber banding
2. consider using mvvm for stuff
