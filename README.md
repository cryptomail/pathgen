###Pathgen -- Create, save, and play  paths mit der maus 
######(Disclaimer, I don't speak German)

###I want you to be able to:
1. create a canvas viewport
2. rubber band path points
3. delete a path point
4. modify x/y of a path point
4. select a path point and change its final orientation
5. select two adjascent path points and change the time it takes to pass between them
6. set global defaults for path points like changing the time it takes to pass between them, and orientation
7. set img/sprite for running the simulation
8. run simulation
9. output to JSON for saving


###Todo:
1. ~~implement rubber banding [ 03/09/2014 wait didn't I just do that! \o/ yay]~~
2. ~~consider using mvvm for stuff [ 3/14/2014 oh yeah baby...sorry @btford went with the supercharged water scooter but I still love your work :) ]~~
3. ~~JSON editor for input/output [done 3/30/2014]~~
4. ~~resize [done 3/14/2014 YAY PI DAY]~~
5. ~~put in object model (see 2) [ 03/09/2014 now have better encapsulated js objects ]~~
6. ~~delete points [done 3/15/2014]~~
7. ~~put segments in list [done 3/16/2014]~~
8. ~~need to have panel for interval between points (on segments)  [done 3/17/2014]~~
9. ~~Present user with rotation panel when they click on point.~~
10. Begin simulation runner [started 3/28.2014]
11. Start building the app
12. ~~Added sprite for the path simulator object [done 3/30/2014]~~
13. Need to describe size of sprite in simulator
14. ~~Added versioning to path info [done 3/30/2014]~~
15. Think about animation patters and design.
